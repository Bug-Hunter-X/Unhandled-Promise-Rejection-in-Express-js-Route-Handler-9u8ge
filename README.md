This repository demonstrates a common error in Node.js Express applications: unhandled promise rejections. The `bug.js` file shows an Express route handler that simulates an asynchronous operation.  If the random number generated is greater than 0.5, an error is thrown without proper handling, causing the application to crash. The solution in `bugSolution.js` demonstrates how to use `try...catch` blocks to handle these errors gracefully.
